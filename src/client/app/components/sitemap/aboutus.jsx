	ABOUT US
	At Leaside Village Dental, we pride ourselves in providing highly individualized dental care. We realize that the vast majority of patients have some form of dental anxiety. Hence, we ensure that our patients can come in and enjoy our warm and friendly atmosphere, heat and massage dental chairs, watch TV, or even use laughing gas if required to allay their fears; all while feeling good about getting your dental treatment done in an environmentally conscious green office! 

	Our facility has been built to meet LEED standards and we are a completely digital office! We use digital x-rays to reduce radiation exposure for our patients and intra-oral cameras to educate our patients about their oral health. Call us to schedule a complimentary facility tour today to know more about our practice and find out if it is right for you. 

	We are located in the Leaside Village (Longo's) plaza above Five Guys. With free parking and evening and weekend appointments available, we make it convenient for our patients to take care of their oral health. Make us a partner in your oral health as we strive to change lives for the better, one smile at a time!
